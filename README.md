**I am an aspiring and critical thinking data scientist with rapidly developing skills in Python. I have a strong and growing portfolio of work and a good understanding of databases and spreadsheets. I am currently doing a data science skills bootcamp with HyperionDev, which covers areas such as data analysis, data visualisation, machine learning and natural language processing.**

### Reach me: 
**By email.**
### Projects sought: 
**Looking to work on projects that involve data analytics, machine learning and NLP.**

## Stack
* Python
  * Libraries and modules: Numpy, Pandas, PyPlot, Seaborn, Scikit-learn and SpaCy
* Excel
* SQL (beginner)
* HTML
* CSS

## Tech interests
I have particular interests in data science, natural language processing and machine learning.

## Projects
* I have created programs that use dictionaries, classes, functions, and data frames, and I created a regression model to build a supervised machine learning program that can make predictions on inputted data. 
* I have created a program using natural language processing (tokenisation, lemmatisation, entity recognition and word-vector similarity) that gives suggestions to users about movies to watch next based on their previous viewing.
* I also created a program that can calculate home loan repayments and interest on investments (see my Github repo).

## Outside of tech
* I am a qualified Speech and Language Therapist
* I have project management experience
* Outside of work I enjoy hiking, as well as studying linguistics, foreign languages and history
